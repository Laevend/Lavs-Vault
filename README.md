# Lavs-Vault
Lavs Vault (Laevens Vault) is a paper plugin that allows you to vault (remove) or unvault (add back) items/blocks in Minecraft (Including specific enchantments, potions, and tipped arrows).
Items can be vaulted in 2 ways: 'cannot_obtain' and 'cannot_use'.
When an item/block is vaulted under 'cannot_obtain', players will not be able to obtain this item/block, either naturally by finding it in the environment (breaking blocks), looting chests, or manufacturing it.
When an item/block is vaulted under 'cannot_use' players will not be able to use this item/block, consume it, place it, interact with it, equip it etc.

## Features
